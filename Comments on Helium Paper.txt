-public keys for all participants are stored in the blockchain
-as number of devices and networks increases, noise occurs -> coexistence performance
-frequency hopping schemes as cheaper alternative to more expensive hardware parts (radios) -> does this increase the compatible
frequency range too much?
-possible fabrication of Hotspot geolocation information
-Routers= internet-deployed applications; they route data packets received from Devices via Hotspots to HTTP or MQTT endpoint
(to the Internet)
