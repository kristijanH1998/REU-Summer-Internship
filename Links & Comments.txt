	Comments: "Narrowband allows for extremely long-range communications, with data rates that scale both up and down
	depending on the density of Hotspots." means that if an area is not densely scattered with hotspots, data transmission rates in it might be too
	low. An isolated device that cannot connect to many nearby hotspots will then have to send or receive data at low speeds. This means that if 
	more than a few devices require data transfer in a remote area with few hotspots, their transmission rates will be lower than for example in the
	middle of an area with a dense network of hotspots.

                                                                          "Bitcoin and the other digital currencies considered here are decentralized systems, i.e., have no central authority to validate and settle transactions. They use only cryptography (and a clever incentive system) to control transactions, manage the supply, and to prevent fraud. Hence, they often are referred to as cryptocurrencies. Once confirmed, all transactions are stored digitally and recorded in a “blockchain”, which can be thought of as an accounting system. Payments are validated by a decentralized network."
									  "Despite the qualitative improvements introduced by other currencies, Bitcoin managed to hold and even increase its leading position in the markets."
									  "In 2009, miners used standard home computers. By 2011, they discovered computer graphic cards could perform the calculation faster. The continuing competition for faster mining calculations created an arms race."
									  Refer to Reinforcement and Substitution Effects (compare with HNT).
									  "Prices should not only reflect other variables that market participants may observe (e.g., the transactions recorded in Bitcoin’s blockchain) but also reflect the expectations of anything that may influence Bitcoin’s value in the future, for example current and expected future strength of the network effects."

COMMENTS:
-most hotspots provide PoC validation and witnessing services, instead of having most of them transfer data through the network (data packets). This is not
the original idea of the Helium Foundation's HNT resource distribution. Moreover, data packet transfer is low given how much wireless networks are used
nowadays to send data between users and providers.
