QUESTIONS: 
1) min_time and max_time are specified at the end of http request, what about other parameters? Does order matter? NO IT DOES NOT, USE & FOR PARAMETERS IN HTTPS
2) can we run a loop to cover multiple nodes in a wider geographic area? Maybe if their addresses are numbered in a series.  FIND GEOLOCATION FOR EACH NODE
3) What time intervals to use? (For HNT Rewards, Transactions, etc.) LARGER TIME INTERVALS, HOW OFTEN ARE HOTSPOTS BEING USED? EVERY WEEK/DAY FOR THE LAST YEAR -> TO MAKE GRAPHS OVER TIME 
4) What do yellow lines coming out of a node represent?

PUT JSON RESULTS IN A DATA STRUCTURE (SET OF DICTIONARIES, NUMPY ARRAY,***PANDAS DATAFRAME*** etc.) MAKE IT MORE READABLE
PANDAS USES MATPLOTLIB - SEARCH DATAFRAME ON GOOGLE

THINK ABOUT HOW TO STORE ALL THIS DATA: LIST OF DICTIONARIES/ARRAYS (JUST EXAMPLE)

6/26: Hotspot Location Box Search (under "Hotspots" in the Blockchain API): to find all hotspots in a square area given (4 coordinates)
      Activity for Account (under "Accounts" in the Blockchain API): fetches transactions for an account
      Hotspot Location Distance Search: fetches hotspots within a certain distance from the selected latitude/longitude (under "Hotspots")
      Hotspots for H3 Index - fetches all the hotspots in a given node(hex) (under "Hotspots")
6/27: List Hotspots for a City under "Cities" in Blockchain API: find all hotspots for a given city

Week 5: - Researched Pandas library in Python, practiced its syntax and examples of DataFrame objects and their manipulation.
	  Set up the environment for Pandas library in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook. 
	  Managed to create successive HTTPS calls to Blockchain API using the Cursor code and a loop in Python.

Goals:
1)Nodes Data Transfers and Nodes HNT earnings : Hotspot Activity
2)User/subscribers connections to nodes and data transfers: Activity for Account
3)Nodes that earn HNT from mining (+ranking, if possible):

*Rewards on the rewards list in Helium Explorer correspond to each rewards_v2 value on the HTTPS request (hotspot/activity) output 
*To get results for specific query parameters in HTTPS requests, first enter the parameter in HTTPS request, then copy the output cursor and copy it 
back to HTTPS to get the desired result

Next:
TOTAL EARNINGS FOR EACH HOTSPOTS
DATARATE/DATA TRANSFER
UPLOAD JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS, NOTEPAD FILES TO GITHUB
SIZE/AMOUNT OF DATA BEING SENT IN TRANSACTIONS
MINI STEEL WEASEL : DATA PACKETS TRANSACTIONS

TRY TO COLLECT DATA BY FRIDAY (7/8); MEET ON THURSDAY (7/7) AT 1 PM

FIND PERCENTAGE OF HOTSPOT AREA OF HOW MANY HOTSPOTS PROVIDE DATA TRANSFER/HOW MANY PROVIDE POC REWARDS
PLOT AMOUNT OF DATA TRANSFERRED FOR THE AREA
PLOT AMOUNT OF DATA PER HOTSPOT THAT TRANSFERS DATA
EXTRA: ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
PUSH ALL FILES ON THE REPO FOR SHARED USE
